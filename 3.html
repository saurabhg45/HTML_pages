    <p>The forgotten temple city of Bagan in Myanmar is like a bizarre fairytale, with a landscape of mysterious and exotic pagodas that goes beyond just culture shock.

        We felt like time travelers stepping into the ancient ruins of the Bagan Myanmar temples. In ages past, there were more than 10,000 shrines and monasteries here, and the Burma temples still standing are completely fascinating to explore and photograph.
        
        This travel guide for Bagan will explain how to get there, which temples to see, and everything else you need to know before you go!</p>
