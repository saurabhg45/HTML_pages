    <p>Thanks to the tropical climate and mountains in Bali, there are dozens of natural waterfalls to see on the island, and many of the best ones are easy to reach from popular areas like Ubud.

        Some of these waterfall hikes are well known to tourists, while others are hidden gems with no people. North Bali is especially known for having some amazing waterfalls. Either way, all of them are worth seeing.
