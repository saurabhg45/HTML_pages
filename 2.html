    <p>No traveler’s bucket list would be complete without a visit to the world famous Angkor Wat Cambodia temple. It’s a profound and heavy experience.

        Exploring Angkor feels a bit like stepping into The Jungle Book. These massive Hindu temple ruins are almost 1,000 years old, and you can tell it.
        
        Everywhere you look, the once fantastic buildings have been shaped by time and nature — with broken walls, caved in ceilings, and huge tree roots and jungle foliage slowly consuming the temples.</p>
